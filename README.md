# API Calls

At this time, the API does not require an API key. Make API requests by sending HTTP `GET` requests to the desired URL.

URLs are relative to the hosting domain, currently: `https://mockdata-u.vercel.app/`

## Mock Student Data

To mock data for a single student, use the end point: `/api/student/`

To mock data for multiple students, enter an integer after the above call corresponding to the number of students you want to mock. Example: `/api/student/5` would mock data for 5 students.

Example student:

```json
{
